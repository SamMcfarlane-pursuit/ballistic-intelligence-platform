## 🤖 **AI Agent System Workflow**

### **Agent 1: Funding Announcement Agent**
**Mission**: Automated cybersecurity funding intelligence with 24/7 monitoring

**Execution Schedule**: Every 4 hours (6x daily)
**Tools**: RSS feeds, NewsAPI, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Database

#### **Phase 1: Gather (RSS & News Monitoring)**
```bash
# Monitor RSS feeds
- TechCrunch Funding: techcrunch.com/category/venture/feed/
- PR Newswire Tech: prnewswire.com/rss/technology-sector.xml
- Business Wire Security: businesswire.com security RSS
- NewsAPI Cybersecurity: newsapi.org cybersecurity funding search
```

#### **Phase 2: Process (NER with Gemini)**
- Extract full article text from gathered sources
- Send to Gemini 2.0 Flash with extraction prompt:
```
Extract the following entities from this funding announcement:
- ORGANIZATION: Company name and all investor names
- MONEY: Exact funding amount (convert to USD if needed)  
- FUNDING_STAGE: Round type (Seed, Series A, etc.)
- TECHNOLOGY: Cybersecurity category
- DATE: Announcement date
Return as JSON with confidence scores for each field.
```
- Parse LLM response into structured data

#### **Phase 3: Analyze (Deduplication & Save)**
- Normalize company name using standardized algorithm:
  - Convert to lowercase
  - Remove legal suffixes (Inc., LLC, Ltd., Corp.)
  - Remove leading "The"
  - Strip special characters except hyphens
  - Trim whitespace
- Check for duplicates using composite key:
  - Query for existing record with same name_normalized, round_type, announced_date within ±7 days
- Action logic:
  - If duplicate found: Enrich existing record (add new investor, update source URLs)
  - If new: Insert into companies/funding_rounds, trigger Company Profiling Agent
- Output: New/updated records in companies, funding_rounds, investors tables

### **Agent 2: Company Profiling Agent**
**Mission**: Build comprehensive company profiles with firmographic and team data

**Execution Schedule**: Triggered automatically when Funding Agent discovers new company
**Tools**: CrunchbaseSearch, GoogleSearch, ReadWebsiteContent, WriteToSupabase

#### **Tier 1: Structured Databases (Automated)**
- Search Crunchbase public company page:
  - Extract: website, founded_year, employee_range, location
  - Parse team members from "People" section
- Search AngelList public profile:
  - Extract: Team members, company description
  - Cross-verify data from Crunchbase
- Update database: Write to companies and company_team_members tables

#### **Tier 2: Broader Web Search (Automated)**
If Tier 1 is incomplete:
- Strategic searches:
  - "[Company Name]" founder OR co-founder
  - site:techcrunch.com "[Company Name]" funding
  - site:prnewswire.com "[Company Name]"
- Parse company website:
  - Fetch "About Us" page
  - Extract team members from "Team" or "Leadership" sections

#### **Tier 3: Manual Fallback (Human-in-the-Loop)**
If critical data still missing:
- Create task in verification_tasks:
  - task_type: "missing_founders" or "verify_employee_count"
  - description: "Please verify founders on LinkedIn: [link]"
  - Provide direct link to company's LinkedIn page
- Output: Populated companies and company_team_members records, or verification task created

### **Agent 3: News & Signals Agent**
**Mission**: Monitor and categorize business signals indicating company momentum

**Execution Schedule**: Once every 24 hours at 2:00 AM, runs for each company in database
**Tools**: NewsAPISearch, ReadWebsiteContent, WriteToSupabase, CreateJob

#### **Phase 1: Gather (Targeted Monitoring)**
For each company in database:
- Company website monitoring:
  - Fetch /blog, /newsroom, /press pages
  - Extract articles published in last 30 days
- NewsAPI targeted searches:
  - "[Company Name]" AND (partnership OR integration)
  - "[Company Name]" AND ("new product" OR launch)
  - "[Company Name]" AND (acquisition OR "acquires")
- Social media (manual check for MVP):
  - Create verification task to check company LinkedIn for major announcements

#### **Phase 2: Process (Event Extraction)**
Send article text to Gemini 2.0 Flash with prompt:
```
Analyze this article about [Company Name].
Identify business events and categorize as:
- Partnership: "partners with", "integrates with", "collaboration"
- Product Launch: "launches", "unveils", "releases", "introduces"  
- Executive Hire: "appoints", "hires", "names", "CXO joins"
- Customer Win: "customer story", "[Fortune 500] selects", "case study"
- Acquisition: "acquires", "acquisition of"
- Award/Recognition: "named", "recognized", "award"

For each event, extract:
- Event type
- Event date  
- 2-sentence summary
- Sentiment (positive/neutral/negative)
```
Parse LLM response

#### **Phase 3: Analyze (Sentiment & Timeline)**
- Validate event relevance:
  - Discard generic news (e.g., industry reports mentioning company)
  - Keep only company-specific announcements
- Assign sentiment:
  - Positive: Partnerships, product launches, customer wins, awards
  - Neutral: Executive hires (unless C-suite)
  - Negative: Layoffs, security incidents, lawsuits
- Save to database:
  - Insert into signals table
  - Link to company_id
  - Store source_url for reference
- Output: Timeline of events in signals table for dashboard display
