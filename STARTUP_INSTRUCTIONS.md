```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

#### **Issue: Build Errors**
```
🚨 Error detected: [build error]
```
**Solution**: Check for syntax errors in your code files

#### **Issue: Timeout**
```
⏰ Next.js startup timeout
```
**Solution**: Try the comprehensive fix:
```bash
node fix-nextjs-startup.js
```

## 📊 **Monitor Your Startup**

### **In Another Terminal** (Optional)
Run this to monitor the startup process:
```bash
node monitor-startup.js
```

This will show real-time status updates every 10 seconds.

## 🎉 **Once Running Successfully**

### **Test Your Enhanced Features**

1. **Visit Data Management**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/data-management
   - Click the **"Batch Process"** tab
   - Try **"Load Sample Batch"** for quick testing

2. **Test Batch Processing**
   - Paste multiple articles separated by `---`
   - Click **"Process Batch"**
   - Watch real-time progress updates

3. **Verify Intelligence Center**
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/intelligence-center
   - Check all systems are operational

### **System Health Check**
```bash
# In another terminal (after server is running)
node test-system-health.js
```

---

## 💡 **Tips**

### **Keep Terminal Open**
- The server runs in your terminal
- Keep it open to maintain the server
- Press **Ctrl+C** to stop when done

### **Development Workflow**
- Server automatically reloads when you edit files
- No need to restart for code changes
- Only restart if you change configuration files

### **Performance**
- First startup may take longer (building cache)
- Subsequent startups will be faster
- Hot reload works for instant updates

## 🚨 **Emergency Fixes**

### **If Nothing Works**
```bash
# Nuclear option - complete reset
rm -rf .next node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
node start-with-verification.js
```

### **Alternative Port**
If port 3000 is permanently blocked:
```bash
# Edit package.json to use port 3001
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```
