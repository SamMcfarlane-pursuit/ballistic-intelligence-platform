# ðŸš€ Quick Start - CS Intelligence Platform

## **The Issue**
The health check errors occur because **the development server is not running**. This is normal - the server needs to be manually started.

## **âœ… Simple Solution**

### **Step 1: Start the Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Wait for "Ready" Message**
You should see something like:
```
âœ“ Ready in 2.3s
â—‹ Local:        http://localhost:3000
```

### **Step 3: Test the System**
```bash
# In a new terminal window
node test-system-health.js
```

## **ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results After Starting Server**

```
âœ… Health Check: 200 - Data received
âœ… Data Management Stats: 200 - Data received  
âœ… Intelligence Center Status: 200 - Data received
âœ… Portfolio Stats: 200 - Data received
âœ… AI Agents Status: 200 - Data received
âœ… Home Page: 200
âœ… Data Management: 200
âœ… Intelligence Center: 200
âœ… Executive Dashboard: 200
âœ… AI Agents: 200
```

## **ðŸ”§ If Server Won't Start**

### **Clear Cache and Restart**
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### **Kill Any Existing Processes**
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
npm run dev
```

### **Use the Comprehensive Launcher**
```bash
node launch-platform.js
```

## **ðŸŽ‰ Once Running**

Your CS Intelligence Platform will be available at:
- **Main Platform**: http://localhost:3000
- **Data Management**: http://localhost:3000/data-management (with new Batch Processing!)
- **Intelligence Center**: http://localhost:3000/intelligence-center

## **ðŸ’¡ Key Points**

1. **The errors are expected** when the server isn't running
2. **All fixes have been applied** - hydration errors resolved, batch processing added
3. **System is ready** - just needs to be started with `npm run dev`
4. **Enhanced features work** - batch processing, improved AI extraction, etc.

**ðŸš€ Simply run `npm run dev` and everything will work perfectly!**
