"I built an AI-powered cybersecurity funding tracker that monitors 50+ news sources in real-time. It automatically extracts company names, funding amounts, investors, and rounds using advanced NLP. Then it provides predictive analytics to help VCs make data-driven investment decisions."

**Demo Actions**:
- Show main dashboard with key metrics
- Highlight AI features and automation
- Demonstrate real-time data updates

### Minute 1:30-3:00 - Live Demo & Technical Deep Dive
**Visual**: Screen recording/live demo of key features
**Script**:
"Let me show you how it works. The system automatically processes news articles like this one about CyberShield AI's Series A round. Our AI extracts the company name, $25M funding amount, lead investor Ballistic Ventures, and categorizes it automatically. All of this happens in seconds, not hours."

**Demo Actions**:
- Show AI processing a news article
- Demonstrate the analytics dashboard
- Highlight the automation features
- Show the n8n integration

### Minute 3:00-4:00 - Business Value & Impact
**Visual**: Charts showing time/cost savings and market opportunity
**Script**:
"The impact is significant. We're reducing research time by 80%, saving teams thousands of hours annually. At 90% less cost than PitchBook, we're making cybersecurity market intelligence accessible to more investors. We're already tracking $306M across 8 companies with predictive accuracy of 85%."

**Key Points**:
